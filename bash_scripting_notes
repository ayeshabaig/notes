BASH Scripting Notes

.bash_profile
only works when you login
.bashrc loaded when a new tab is opened

# .bash_profile

# Get the aliases and functions
if [ .f ~/.bashrc ]; then
	. ~/.bashrc
fi

# User specific environment and startup programs

PATH=$PATH:HOME/bin

export PATH

__________


# .bashr

# User specified aliases and functions

alias rm='rm -i'
alias cp='cp -i'
alias mv='mv -i'

# Source the global definition
if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
	. /etc/bashrc
fi

---------

env | grep HISTCONTROL
HISTCONTROL=ignoredups - doesn't write duplicate commands to bash_history
export HISTCONTROL=$HISTCONTROL:ignorespace - when you run a command with a
	space in front, it won't be captured in bash_history

.bash_logout - called whenever a bash session is ended
- can be used to reset the .bash_profile and .bashrc files to original

pwd
whoami

bash script - opens a new shell and executes file
-----
#!/bin/bash - runs script in new shell

clear

echo "Hello World"
----

.sh is not necessary, but useful

need to chmod to make executable
chmod u+x test.sh

vim env.sh

-----
#!/bin/bash

clear

echo "This script will give us environment information"
echo "================================================"
echo "Hello Username: $USER"
echo ""
echo "Your home directory is: $HOME"
echo ""
echo "Your History File will ignore: $HISTCONTROL"
echo ""
echo "Your Terminal Session Type is: $TERM"
echo ""
-----

make a var in env that is first name
FIRSTNAME="Brian"
no spaces
export FIRSTNAME - make available to env
env | grep FIRSTNAME
export FIRSTNAME="Dave" - overwrites variable
export TODAYSDATE=`date` - set var to output of command `date`

varexample.sh
----
#!/bin/bash

MYUSERNAME="username"
MYPASSWORD="password123"
STARTOFSCRIP= `date`

echo "My login name for this application is: $MYUSERNAME"
echo "My login password for this application is: $MYPASSWORD"
echo "I started this script at: $STARTOFSCRIPT"

ENDOFSCRIPT=`date`

echo "I ended this script at: $ENDOFSCRIPT"
----

#!/bin/bash
# This line is intended to be used as a general description
# of the script and anything is does

clear # clears the screen

MYUSERNAME="Brian" # the username for this application

echo "We are using the default user called: $MYUSERNAME" # display to the console

DATETIMESTAMP=`date`

echo "This is when the script was run: $DATETIMESTAMP" # this is the timestamp of run
----
substitution.sh
----
#!/bin/bash
# This script is intended to show how to do simple substitution

shopt -s expand_aliases
alias TODAY="date"
alias UFILES="find /home -user user"

TODAYSDATE=`date`
USERFILES=`find /home -user user`

echo "Today's Date: $TODAYSDATE"
echo "All Files Owned by USER: $USERFILES"

A=`TODAY`
B=`UFILES`

echo "With Alias, TODAY is: $A"
echo "With Alias, UFILES is: $B"

----
errors.sh
----
#!/bin/bash
# this is to show exit status types
set -e # exits script as soon as an error is encountered

expr 1 + 5
echo $?

rm doodles.sh
echo $?

expr 10 + 10
echo $?
----

expr 2 + 2 -> needs spaces around numbers
expr 10 \* 8  -> need to escape *
expr \( 2 + 2 \) \* 4 -> need to escape parens as well

----
expressions.sh
----
#!/bin/bash
# expression evaluation

expr 2 + 2

expr 2 + 2 \* 4

expr \( 2 + 2 \) \* 4
----

all vars on system
man printenv
printenv | more
env and print_env almost the same output
set - env variables specific to this session
----

quoting chars
echo "\$COL" -> $COL
echo '$COL' -> $COL - literally prints everything in quotes, no substitution
escape single char, use \
echo whole string use ' '
echo "Today's date is: `date`"
` backtick - substitute command in a string

/dev/null is the blackhole of the the computer
anything written to this device, file, or folder (depending on view) will be ignored

----
null.sh
----
#!/bin/bash
# redirect to /dev/null example

echo "This is displaying on the console"

echo "This is going into the black hole" >> /dev/null
----

appending (>>) is preferred to overwriting (>), but both work

----
readsample.sh
----
#!/bin/bash
# interactive script for user input

echo "Enter Your First Name: "
read FIRSTNAME
echo "Enter Your Last Name: "

echo ""
echo "Enter Your Age: "
read USERAGE

echo "In 10 years, You will be `expr $USERAGE + 10` years old."
----

Shell Expansion
echo sh{ot, ort, oot}
shot short shoot
echo st{il, al}l
still stall
echo "${!HO*}" -> echos out env vars starting with HO
HOST HOSTNAME HOSTTYPE
echo "${VARNAME:=valuesomething}" -> set a var and echo it out
echo "$[ 2 * 2 ]" -> 4 -> echos out result of expr in square brackets

variables implicitly declared (loose typing)
MYVAR = 5 -> implicitly determines MYVAR to be a number
declare can set, unset, display type
declare -p MYVAR -> displays value and type of MYVAR
declare -i NEWVAR=10 -> declares as an int
declare +i NEWVAR -> takes away declaration
declare -r READONLY="This is a string we cannot overwrite" -> declares as read-only
readonly MYREADONLY="This string" -> also declares readonly
----
Arrays
MYARRAY=("First", "Second", "Third")
echo MYARRAY -> First -> just shows first item
echo ${MYARRAY[1]} -> Second -> right way to echo by index
echo ${MYARRAY[10]} -> returns nothing
echo ${MYARRAY[*]} -> returns everything in array
MYARRAY[3]="Fourth" -> assigns "Fourth" to index 3
array elements are space delimited, not comma delimited
NEWARRAY=("First","Second","Third")
echo NEWARRAY -> First,Second,Third -> They all got assigned to first index bc no space
----
arrayex.sh
----
#!/bin/bash
# simple array list and loop display
