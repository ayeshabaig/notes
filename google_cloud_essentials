Complete routing support

Kubernetes Engine Fundamentals
Managed, orchestrated environment for containerized applications
Uses Compute Engine to form cluster
Relies on open source Kubernetes cluster management system
Currently only Docker containers are supported
Benefits
  Load-balancing integrated
  Node pools supported
  Automatic cluster and node scaling
  Automatic upgrades
  Automatic repair based on health reports
  Automatic logging and monitoring with Stackdriver

Cloud Functions Fundamentals
Serverless Environment for executing code and connecting cloud services
Fully managed zero infrastructure or management requirements
JavaScript functions in a Node.js wrapper
Triggers:
  HTTP request
  Cloud Storage
  Pub/Sub Event
Use cases:
  Webhooks - Respond to any HTTP request
  Data & Image Processing - Validate/transform data or manipulate images
