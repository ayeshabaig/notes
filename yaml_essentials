YAML is a data serialization language
  "Natural and meaningful"
  AKA Human-readable

Relies on the familiar:
  Works with "agile" languages
    Python, Perl, Ruby, etc.
  Common data types:
    Scalars, lists, arrays
  Common data structures:
    Indentation, dashes, colons
  Common uses:
    Config files
    Storing data

Goals (in order):
    Easily human-readable
    Portable
    Matches native data structures to agile languages
    Consistent and able to support generic tools
    One-pass processing
    Expressive and extensible
    Easy to implement and use
