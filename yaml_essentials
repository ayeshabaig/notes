YAML Essentials

YAML ain't markup language
  Yet another markup language
  2001
  Ingy Dot Net, Clark Evans, Oren Ben-Kiki

YAML is a data serialization language
  "Natural and meaningful"
  AKA Human-readable

Relies on the familiar:
  Works with "agile" languages
    Python, Perl, Ruby, etc.
  Common data types:
    Scalars, lists, arrays
  Common data structures:
    Indentation, dashes, colons
  Common uses:
    Config files
    Storing data

Goals (in order):
    Easily human-readable
    Portable
    Matches native data structures to agile languages
    Consistent and able to support generic tools
    One-pass processing
    Expressive and extensible
    Easy to implement and use

Syntax
Human > computers
 - Spaces, not tabs
 - Indent for structure
 - Dashes for lists
 - Colons for key-value

host: phl-42
 datacenter:
   location: Philadelphia
   cab: 13
 roles:
  - web
  - dns

Character support
  - Printable Unicode
  - Unsupported symbols:
      - C0/C1 blocks
         - Exceptions:
            - Tab
            - Line feeds
            - Carriage return
            - Delete
            - Next line
         - Surrogates
      - Encoding
         - UTF-8
         - UTF-16
         - UTF-32
            - Mandatory for JSON compatibility

YAML Styles
Block or flow:
 - Two forms of styles:
    - Block styles
    - Flow styles

Block Styles
 - Better for humans
 - Less compact
 - The YAML you've probably seen

host: phl-42
datacenter:
  location: Philadelphia
  cab: 13
roles:
  - web
  - dns

Flow styles:
  - An extension of JSON
  - "Folding" long lines of content
  - Tags and anchors

host: "phl-42"
datacenter: { location:
  Philadelphia , cab: 13 }
roles: [ web , dns ]

Mappings
  - Associative arrays, hash tables, key-value pairs, collection
  - Denoted with a colon and a space(: )
  - No duplicate keys
  - Mappings can be nested

Structure:
  - Multiple directives/documents in one file
  - Optional within the YAML Spec
      - May be a requirement for different platforms
  - Triple dashes (---) to mark the start of a file
  - Triple dots(...) to mark the end without closing the data stream

Multi-doc stream
---
host: phl-42
datacenter:
  location: Philadelphia
  cabinet: "13"
  cab_unit: "2"
roles:
  - webserver
  - wp_database

host: phl-43
datacenter:
  location: Philadelphia
  cabinet: "13"
  cab_unit: "3"

Stream with End
---
host: phl-42
datacenter:
  location: Philadelphia
  cab: 13
  cab_unit: 3

space after colon is important
2 space indent under datacenter

Flow styles:
  - Use curly brackets and commas

datacenter: { location:
  Philadelphia , cab: 13 }


Sequences
  - Lists, arrays, collections
  - Denoted with a dash and a space (- )
  - Can be combined with mappings
      - "Mapping of sequences"
      - "Sequence of mappings"

roles:
  - webserver
  - wp_database

  - Cannot be:
      - Blank
      - Nested without mapping

Do this:
- playbooks:
    - wordpress
    - mysql

Don't do this
- playbooks
    - wordpress
    - 
    - mysql

Flow styles:
roles: [ webserver , wp_database ]


Scalars:
  - Stringm number, boolean
      - Whitespace permitted
  - "...presented with zero or more Unicode characters"
  - Mapping: Assigning one scalar to another
  - Use quotes (single or double) to convert a non-string scalar into a string scalar
      - Double quotes permit escape sequences
  - Multiline scalars:
      - Block style(preserve newlines) uses vertical bar

      - Folded style (converts newlines/spacing to single space) uses >

  need to indent all lines to same level

Structures
  - Mutliple directives/documents in one file
  - Optional within the YAML spec
      - May be a requirement for different platforms
  - Triple dashes (---) to mark the start of a file
  - Triple dots (...) to mark the end without closing the data stream
  cab_unit: 2

host: hel-13
datacenter:
  location: Helsinki
  cab: 9
  cab_unit: 1-2
...

Comments
  - Define a comment with an octothorpe and whitespace (# )
  - Inline comments okay
      - Must continue to end of the line
  - Comments cannot be contained in scalars
  - Comments are for humans
      - No actual content should be conveyed through comments
  - Blank lines function as commented lines

Do This:
# Philly DC Host Data
---
host: phl-42
datacenter:
  location: Philadelphia # Reference ID: PHL
  cab: 13
  cab_unit: 2
...

Don't Do This:
#Philly DC Host Data
---
host: phl-42
datacenter:
  location: "Philadelphia # Reference ID: PHL"
  cab: 13
  cab_unit: 2
...
must have space after # and # cannot be within quotes


Tags:
  - Used for:
      - Setting a custom URI
      - Setting local tags
      - Setting a data type
Set a URI:
  - Use the %TAG ! prefix

%TAG ! tag:hostsdata:phl:
---

Set a local tag:
  - Single exclamation point, no space(!)
  - URI: tag:hostsdata:phl:PHL

datacenter:
  location: !PHL Philadelphia

Set data type:
  - Force data type; don't rely on parser
  - Use two exclamation points, no space(!!)

cabinet: !!str 13
cab_unit: !!str 2

Default data types:
seq - Sequence
map - Map
str - String
int - Integer
float - Floating-point decimal
null - Null
binary - Binary code
omap - Ordered map
set - Unordered set

Anchors:
  - Store and reuse data
  - Anchor names can be reused
  - Define anchor with &
  - Reference anchor data with *
  - Anchor a single scalar:

---
host: phl-42
datacenter:
  location: &PHL Philadelphia
---
host: phl-43
datacenter:
  location: *PHL

  - Or a collection

---
roles: &wphost
  - webserver
  - wp_database
...
---
roles: *wphost

# Philly DC Host Data
%TAG ! tag:hostdata:phl:
---
host: phl-42
datacenter:
  location: &PHL Philadelphia # Reference ID: PHL
  cab: !!str 13
  cab_unit: !!str 3
roles: &wphost
  - webserver
  - wp_database

datacenter:
  location: *PHL
  cab: !!str 13
  cab_unit: !!str 4

redefing an anchor will cause the value to get overwritten

Learning Activity
Create an ansible playbook
ssh cloud_user@ip address
su - ansible
ssh-copy-id localhost
vim mariadb.yaml
--- # Install MariaDB
